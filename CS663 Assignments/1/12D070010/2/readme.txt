Running the code:
Add the root folder of the submission with subfolders to your Matlab path and run code/myDriver.m

The standard naming for functions is:
<what-the-function-does>(origImage, <other-parameters>)

In the functions requiring a window size, the parameter passed to the function is half the size of the window.
In the functions requiring a histogram clipping parameter, the parameter passed to the function is the value at which the clipping is made.
