Note that the blob centred at zero looks non-circular because scales of the axes are not the same.

After mean-shift, the new points are marked in green on the same plot:

For the 3000 sample points in the given distribution, and for a minimum movement of 0.0000001 between iterations, the minimum number of convergence steps is 2. The maximum is 5, and the average is 3.35.
